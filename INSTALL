# Bitweaver Notes:

Please consult cgi-bin/config.sample.cgi for a sample configuration. Save
your copy as cgi-bin/config.gci

make sure your temp directory is writable by apache

The easiest way to get the CGI part working is by adding something like this:

ScriptAlias /gigaupload/cgi-bin/ /var/www/html/bitweaver/gigaupload/cgi-bin/
<dirrectory /var/www/html/bitweaver/gigaupload/cgi-bin>
	AllowOverride All
</directory>


to your apache vhost configuration. This will allow xupload/.htaccess file to
take effect and will enable all the CGI requirements for you.

make sure the files in gigaupload/cgi-bin/ are execuable by apache. easiest way of
doing this is by: chmod -R 777 gigaupload/cgi-bin/

good luck!
